# Syllabus

## Description

The course introduces and develops methods for designing and
implementing abstract data types using the Java programming
language. The main focus is on how to build and encapsulate data
objects and their associated operations. Specific topics include
linked structures, recursive structures and algorithms, binary trees,
balanced trees, and hash tables. These topics are fundamental to
programming and are essential to other courses in computer
science. Prerequisites: CMPSCI 121 (or equivalent Java experience) and
Basic Math Skills (R1). Basic Java language concepts are introduced
quickly; if unsure of background, contact instructor. 4 credits.

## Course Materials

The required text for this course is:

* [Object-Oriented Data Structures Using Java], 3rd edition, Nell
  Dale, Daniel Joyce, and Chip Weems (DJW). This course follows the
  book fairly closely. If we add any additional material we will
  provide links to any associated reading. The first and second
  edition of this book are substantially different so you will need to
  pick up the 3rd edition.

Other useful (but not required material) includes:

* [Java Precisely], Peter Sestoft. This book is intended more as a
  reference for people who already know the language, but it has both
  all the details you aren't likely to memorize and a very clear
  definition of exactly what the language is and what it does.
* [Learning Java], 4th edition, Patrick Niemeyer and Daniel Leuck. A
  learn-by-example book about Java. You can read it online for free,
  or buy the e-book.
* [Java API Specification], Standard Edition 7.

course materials and complete the assignments.

## Course Objectives

The objectives of this course are to learn, understand, apply, and
implement a variety of data structures using the Java programming
language. In particular:

* To understand the basics of the underlying machine model.
* To explain software life-cycle activities.
* To design and implement a Java class using primitive data types for its instance variables.
* To understand and use Big-O notation to describe the amount of work done by an algorithm.
* To understand and implement larger programs using multiple Java classes and inheritance.
* To learn advanced Java features such as generics.
* To develop an idea of the entire Java language.
* To learn and understand different ways of arranging data.
* To learn the difference between interface and implementation.
* To learn the detail of data structure implementation.
* To understand the pros/cons of different data structure implementations.
* To learn how to apply a wide variety of data structures for different problems.
* To learn and apply the Java collections library.
* To learn how to analyze general solutions rather than the specific.
* To understand and apply the basics of algorithm analysis.
* To learn and apply Javaâ€™s basic structuring mechanisms including references and arrays.
* To learn and apply abstract data types (ADT).
* To learn and apply a variety of ADTs including stacks, queues, lists, trees, and graphs.
* To learn, understand, and leverage recursion.
* To learn and apply sorting and searching algorithms.
* To learn and apply basic hashing techniques.

## Course Assessment

the course is scored on your ability to program and your understanding
of data structures. Because this is a programming intensive course the
programming assignments will be heavily weighted. We will also have
weekly quizzes that will guide you in your understanding of
data structures and three exams that will test your understanding of
the material that has been covered.

### Assessment and Grading

Each assessment component is worth a fixed number of points. At any
point during the course you can easily calculate your current grade by
the number of points you have achieved with respect to the total
number of points you can attain in the course. You should read the
course policies to understand lateness.

* **Programming Assignments (900 points):** There will be 9
  programming assignments assigned during the course. Each programming
  assignment will be assigned at that start of the week and they will
  be due at the beginning of the next week. Each programming
  assignment is worth 100 points. Late assignments will not be
  accepted. Programming assignments will be submitted as Eclipse
  projects using [moodle]. The programming assignments will be
  automatically graded using both *public* and *private* unit
  tests. You will have access to the public unit tests to better
  understand how we are testing your submission. The private tests
  will be additional tests only available to us.
* **Exercises Assignments (200 points):** There will be 8 exercise
  assignments. Each exercise assignment will be given at the beginning
  of the week and will be due at the beginning of the next week. Each
  exercise assignment is worth 25 points. Late submissions will not be
  accepted. Exercise assignments will be submitted as a text file
  using [moodle].
* **Unit Exams (300 points):** There will be three unit exams. The
  unit exams will be taking online through [moodle] and must be
  completed during the available time. Each unit exam will take
  approximately 1 hour to complete, however, you will have 2
  hours. You will be able to take the online exams at any point within
  a three day time window. Each unit exam is worth 100 points.
* **Final Exam (300 points):** There will be 1 final exam. The final
  exam will be taken online through [moodle] and must be completed
  during the available time. The final exam will take approximately 2
  hours to complete, however, you will have 3 hours. You will be able
  to take the final exam at any point within a three day time
  window. The final exam is worth 300 points.

The total number of points you can achieve in this course is
**1700**. The approximate percentage of each assessment component with
respect to your total grade is as follows:

* 53% Programming Assignments (6% each)
* 12% Exercise Assignments (1.5% each)
* 17% Unit Exams (6% each)
* 18% Final Exam

**There is no opportunity for extra credit in this course**
