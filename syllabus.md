# CMPSCI 187 Programming With Data Structures - Syllabus

## Description
This course introduces and develops methods for designing and
implementing abstract data types using the Java programming
language. The main focus is on how to build and encapsulate data
objects and their associated operations. Specific topics include
linked structures, recursive structures and algorithms, binary trees,
balanced trees, and hash tables. These topics are fundamental to
programming and are essential to other courses in computer
science. 4 credits.

## Prerequisites
CMPSCI 121 (or equivalent Java experience) and Basic Math Skills
(R1). Basic Java language concepts and introduced quickly.

## Required Texts
- [Object-Oriented Data Structures Using Java, 3rd Edition][book],
  Dale, Joyce, and Weems.

## Objectives
The objectives of this course are to learn, understand, apply, and
implement a variety of data structures using the Java programming
language. In particular:

- To understand the basics of the underlying machine model.
- To explain software life-cycle activities.
- To design and implement a Java class using primitive data types for
  its instance variables.
- To understand and use Big-O notation to describe the amount of work
  done by an algorithm.
- To understand and implement larger programs using multiple Java
  classes and inheritance.
- To learn advanced Java features such as generics.
- To develop an idea of the entire Java language.
- To learn and understand different ways of arranging data.
- To learn the difference between interface and implementation.
- To learn the detail of data structure implementation.
- To understand the pros/cons of different data structure
  implementations.
- To learn how to apply a wide variety of data structures for
  different problems.
- To learn and apply the Java collections library.
- To learn how to analyze general solutions rather than the specific.
- To understand and apply the basics of algorithm analysis.
- To learn and apply Java's basic structuring mechanisms including
  references and arrays.
- To learn and apply abstract data types (ADT).
- To learn and apply a variety of ADTs including stacks, queues,
  lists, trees, and graphs.
- To learn, understand, and leverage recursion.
- To learn and apply sorting and searching algorithms.
- To learn and apply basic hashing techniques.

## Assessment
Student knowledge of the course will be assessed from a variety of
angles. This includes assigned readings, exams, projects, written
assignments, and discussion tasks on the online course

- 7 Projects
- 7 Written Assignments
- Weekly Discussion Tasks
- Midterm Take Home Exam
- Final Take Home Exam

## Grading Scheme
Students' grades are based on the following scheme:

- 40% Projects
- 20% Written Assignments 
- 20% Midterm Exam
- 20% Final Exam

## Details
**Assignments**: There will be 7 intensive weekly written/programming
assignments. An assignment is a combination of mostly programming
exercises and possibly a written component. Assignments will be
submitted electronically through blackboard. Assignments will not
necessarily be graded on the basis of how it works or if it does not work
- I will review your code to determine an appropriate score - at the
same time it is important to submit a functioning program if that is
what the assignment calls for.

**Quizzes**: There will be 8 quizzes that will be based on the material
for the week. They will be assigned and due at the end of the week on
Friday. Quizzes will be online and timed through the blackboard
system. Quizzes will be multiple choice and true/false and
automatically graded by blackboard.

**Exams**: There will be a Midterm and Final exam. Both exams are will
be online exams and will be a combination of multiple choice, short
answer, true/false, and programming exercises that you will be
required to complete. The exams will be available during a specified
time period and timed. For example, the midterm exam will be made
available during a 2-day time period where you have to take a
75-minute timed online exam completed during the 2-day time
period. Naturally, the exams are open book/notes, however, to be
successful in the online exam it should not require you to read a
chapter from a book to answer a question. During the examination
period you are required to work alone and any suspicion of academic
dishonesty will be handled appropriately.

**Final Grades**: Your grades will be based on the above scheme,
however, there are a number of factors that help determine your final
grade for the course. This includes the quality of your work,
participation, etc. For example, if you have excellent scores through
out the entire semester and you bombed the midterm I would be more
likely to push your grade up if you are on the border of receiving a
more desirable grade. It is also possible that I not give you that
opportunity if you have low scores, missing assignments, assignments
that have solutions that are sub-standard (i.e., they do not meet
expectations for a university-level course). Grades will be posted in
the blackboard gradebook and you will have access to those at any
time. Your grades on blackboard, however, are only an approximation as
to what your final grade will be for the course.

## Attendance & Participation
Given that this is an online course there is no attendance policy. You
are responsible for checking the course site on blackboard on a daily
basis. There may be some assignments that require you to post comments
to an online discussion forum - you will be responsible for posting an
answer. You are also responsible for participating in the general Q&A
forum on blackboard. This may be in the form of asking or answering a
question. Your participation will be included as part of your overall
grade for the course.

## Assignment Submission
Assignments will be submitted electronically through blackboard on the
assigned due date. Barring truly exceptional circumstances, such as
documented medical events, late homework will not be accepted for full
credit. You are responsible for learning how to use blackboard and how
to properly submit an assignment. Assignments will not be accepted if
you fail to submit the assignment properly through blackboard or
submit the wrong solution - so don't ask for extensions. UMass policy
is that students are required to notify instructors at least one week
in advance that they will miss class in order to observe a religious
holiday. Makeup work will not be given, so don't ask.

## Office Hours and Communication
I will have virtual office hours (chat sessions) that will be posted
on blackboard. I will also respond to messages sent to me on
blackboard, but if they are beneficial to the entire class I will ask
that you post your question in the discussion forum. The discussion
forum should be your first choice for asking questions as others most
certainly have the same question and your participation in this course
includes responding to questions posted online - it will help your
grade in the end. You should check the discussion forum before asking
your question to see if the same question has already been posted. I
will not answer questions directed towards me that have already been
answered in the discussion forum. I expect all communication to occur
through the blackboard learning system. It is unlikely that I will
respond to individual emails sent to my personal email account. I will
be more likely to respond to questions regarding assignments when they
are posted in a timely manner. That is, do not wait until the last day
to work on an assignment and expect me to answer all of your questions
when it is due the following morning.

## Academic Honesty
All submitted work must be your own. Although students may
collaborate, each student is expected to produce his or her own
solution to the assignment problems. You may not collaborate with each
other on exams. I encourage you to discuss assignment problems with
others in this course, however, your writing (including code) of
solutions must be your own. You should record as part of your
submission those individuals you collaborated with during a
this will help protect you if academic dishonesty is
suspected. Any outside material including online resources that you
used to develop a solution must be recorded as part of your
submission. Of course, copying any material directly or indirectly
from the web is considered dishonest and is much easier than you think
for me to detect, so don't do it!

When in doubt, contact me about whether a potential action would be
considered plagiarism. Copying or using sections of someone else's
program or assignment, even if it has been modified by you, is not
acceptable. The University has very clear guidelines for academic
misconduct and I will be vigorous in enforcing them. Please see the
UMass policy on [academic honesty][honesty] if you need clarification.
