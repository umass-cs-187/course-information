## CMPSCI 187 Programming With Data Structures - Syllabus

## Description
This course introduces and develops methods for designing and
implementing abstract data types using the Java programming
language. The main focus is on how to build and encapsulate data
objects and their associated operations. Specific topics include
linked structures, recursive structures and algorithms, binary trees,
balanced trees, and hash tables. These topics are fundamental to
programming and are essential to other courses in computer
science. 4 credits.

## Prerequisites
CMPSCI 121 (or equivalent Java experience) and Basic Math Skills
(R1). Basic Java language concepts and introduced quickly.

## Required Texts
- [Object-Oriented Data Structures Using Java, 3rd Edition][book],
  Dale, Joyce, and Weems.

## Objectives
The objectives of this course are to learn, understand, apply, and
implement a variety of data structures using the Java programming
language. In particular:

- To understand the basics of the underlying machine model.
- To explain software life-cycle activities.
- To design and implement a Java class using primitive data types for
  its instance variables.
- To understand and use Big-O notation to describe the amount of work
  done by an algorithm.
- To understand and implement larger programs using multiple Java
  classes and inheritance.
- To learn advanced Java features such as generics.
- To develop an idea of the entire Java language.
- To learn and understand different ways of arranging data.
- To learn the difference between interface and implementation.
- To learn the detail of data structure implementation.
- To understand the pros/cons of different data structure
  implementations.
- To learn how to apply a wide variety of data structures for
  different problems.
- To learn and apply the Java collections library.
- To learn how to analyze general solutions rather than the specific.
- To understand and apply the basics of algorithm analysis.
- To learn and apply Java's basic structuring mechanisms including
  references and arrays.
- To learn and apply abstract data types (ADT).
- To learn and apply a variety of ADTs including stacks, queues,
  lists, trees, and graphs.
- To learn, understand, and leverage recursion.
- To learn and apply sorting and searching algorithms.
- To learn and apply basic hashing techniques.

## Assessment
Student knowledge of the course will be assessed from a variety of
angles. This includes assigned readings, exams, projects, written
assignments, and discussion tasks on the online course

- 7 Project Assignments
- 7 Discussion Assignments
- Midterm Exam
- Final Exam

## Grading Scheme
Students' grades are based on the following scheme:

- 40% Project Assignments
- 20% Discussion Assignments
- 20% Midterm Exam
- 20% Final Exam

## Details
**Project Assignments**: There will be 7 intensive weekly Project Assignments
that you will complete individually. An assignment is a combination of mostly
programming exercises and possibly a written component. Project Assignments
will be submitted electronically through email. Assignments will not
necessarily be graded on the basis of how it works or if it does not work - we
will review your code to determine an appropriate score - at the same time it
is important to submit a functioning program if that is what the assignment
calls for. **If your program does not compile or run you will receive a F for
that assignment**. This may seem harsh, however, it is an important aspect of
programming that you must be attentive to. In addition, if your program does
not compile or run it is very difficult for us to evaluate your work
effectively.

**Discussion Assignments**: There will be 7 Discussion Assignments that will
be based on the material for the week. You will work in groups on each of the
discussion assignments to compose a solution. Each member of a discussion
group will receive the same grade - so, it is important that each member
participate to produce an solid solution. The best solutions (a grade of A)
will be made available for the rest of the participants in the course.

**Exams**: There will be a Midterm and Final exam. Both exams are will
be take home exams and will require you to solve a problem(s) and provide
a solution in the form of program source code and text to be submitted
through email. The final exam is cumulative. During the examination
period you are required to work alone and any suspicion of academic
dishonesty will be handled appropriately. You will be given approximately
three days to complete an exam.

**Final Grades**: Your grades will be based on the above scheme,
however, there are a number of factors that help determine your final
grade for the course. This includes the quality of your work,
participation, etc. For example, if you have excellent scores through
out the entire semester and you bombed the midterm I would be more
likely to push your grade up if you are on the border of receiving a
more desirable grade. It is also possible that I not give you that
opportunity if you have low scores, missing assignments, assignments
that have solutions that are sub-standard (i.e., they do not meet
expectations for a university-level course). A summary of your grades
will be sent to you through email. This summary will include the
points you received for each assessment task (e.g., project, discussion),
the average for that task, and your average up to that point.

## Attendance & Participation
Given that this is an online course there is no attendance policy. You are
responsible for checking the course site on a daily basis (and possibly
multiple times a day). There may be some assignments that require you to post
comments to an online discussion forum - you will be responsible for posting
an answer. You are also responsible for participating in the general Q&A forum.
This may be in the form of asking or answering a question. Your
participation will be used as part of your overall grade for the course.

## Assignment Submission
Assignments will be submitted electronically through email. The email address
will be provided to you at the beginning of the course. You will be required
to send your assignment submissions before the due date of the assignment.
Barring truly exceptional circumstances, such as documented medical events,
late assignments will not be accepted for full credit. You are responsible for
learning how to use email and how to properly submit an assignment.
Assignments will not be accepted if you fail to submit the assignment properly
through email or submit the wrong solution - so don't ask for extensions.
Makeup work will not be given, so don't ask.

## Office Hours and Communication
I will not hold any real office hours. We will be using an online discussion
system for communication. You should communicate with me through this system
rather than email. The discussion forum should be your first choice for asking
questions as others most certainly have the same question and your
participation in this course includes responding to questions posted online -
it will help your grade in the end. You should check the discussion forum
before asking your question to see if the same question has already been
posted. I will not answer questions directed towards me that have already been
answered in the discussion forum. I expect all communication to occur through
the chosen online system. It is unlikely that I will respond to
individual emails sent to my personal email account. I will be more likely to
respond to questions regarding assignments when they are posted in a timely
manner. That is, do not wait until the last day to work on an assignment and
expect me to answer all of your questions when it is due the following
morning.

## Academic Honesty
All submitted work must be your own. Although students may collaborate, each
student is expected to produce his or her own solution to the assignment
problems (unless the assignment is designated as group work). You may not
collaborate with each other on exams. I encourage you to discuss assignment
problems with others in this course, however, your writing (including code) of
solutions must be your own. You should record as part of your submission those
individuals you collaborated with as this will help protect you if academic
dishonesty is suspected. Any outside material including online resources that
you used to develop a solution must be recorded as part of your submission. Of
course, copying any material directly or indirectly from the web is considered
dishonest and is much easier than you think for me to detect, so don't do it!

When in doubt, contact me about whether a potential action would be
considered plagiarism. Copying or using sections of someone else's
program or assignment, even if it has been modified by you, is not
acceptable. The University has very clear guidelines for academic
misconduct and I will be vigorous in enforcing them. Please see the
UMass policy on [academic honesty][honesty] if you need clarification.
