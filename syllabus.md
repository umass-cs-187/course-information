# Syllabus

## Description

The course introduces and develops methods for designing and
implementing abstract data types using the Java programming
language. The main focus is on how to build and encapsulate data
objects and their associated operations. Specific topics include
linked structures, recursive structures and algorithms, binary trees,
balanced trees, and hash tables. These topics are fundamental to
programming and are essential to other courses in computer
science. Prerequisites: CMPSCI 121 (or equivalent Java experience) and
Basic Math Skills (R1). Basic Java language concepts are introduced
quickly; if unsure of background, contact instructor. 4 credits.

## Textbooks

The required texts for this course are:

* [Object-Oriented Data Structures Using Java], Nell Dale, Daniel Joyce,
  and Chip Weems (**required**)
* [Java Precisely], Peter Sestoft

## Course Objectives

The objectives of this course are to learn, understand, apply, and
implement a variety of data structures using the Java programming
language. In particular:

* To understand the basics of the underlying machine model.
* To explain software life-cycle activities.
* To design and implement a Java class using primitive data types for its instance variables.
* To understand and use Big-O notation to describe the amount of work done by an algorithm.
* To understand and implement larger programs using multiple Java classes and inheritance.
* To learn advanced Java features such as generics.
* To develop an idea of the entire Java language.
* To learn and understand different ways of arranging data.
* To learn the difference between interface and implementation.
* To learn the detail of data structure implementation.
* To understand the pros/cons of different data structure implementations.
* To learn how to apply a wide variety of data structures for different problems.
* To learn and apply the Java collections library.
* To learn how to analyze general solutions rather than the specific.
* To understand and apply the basics of algorithm analysis.
* To learn and apply Java’s basic structuring mechanisms including references and arrays.
* To learn and apply abstract data types (ADT).
* To learn and apply a variety of ADTs including stacks, queues, lists, trees, and graphs.
* To learn, understand, and leverage recursion.
* To learn and apply sorting and searching algorithms.
* To learn and apply basic hashing techniques.

## Course Assessment

the course is scored on your ability to program and your understanding
of data structures. Because this is a programming intensive course the
programming assignments will be heavily weighted. We will also have
weekly quizzes that will guide you in your understanding of
data structures and three exams that will test your understanding of
the material that has been covered.

### Grading Scheme

Students' grades are based on the following scheme:

* 50% Programming Assignments
* 20% Quizzes
* 10% Exam 01
* 10% Exam 02
* 10% Exam 03

**There is no opportunity for extra credit in this course.**

**Note**: that we may include/remove assessment criteria as the
semester progresses.

### Details

#### Programming Assignments

There will be several intensive weekly Programming Assignments that
you will complete individually. Programming assignments will exercise
your understanding of material covered during the weekly online
lectures. Your programming assignments will be automatically graded as
well as reviewed by hand to evaluate your understanding. If your
program does not compile or run you will receive a **0 for that
assignment**.

#### Quizzes

There will be weekly quizzes on the material covered in both the
online lectures and readings. The quizzes will be given online through
Moodle and consist of multiple choice and true/false style
questions. Your quizzes will be automatically graded.

#### Exams

There will be three exams. Each exam will be given online through
Moodle. The majority of the questions will be multiple choice and
true/false. The exams will also include short answer questions and
questions that may require you to write code. The majority of the exam
will be graded automatically. The short answer and programming
questions will be graded by hand.

## Academic Dishonesty

All submitted work **must be your own**. Although students may study
together, each student is expected to produce his or her own solution
to the assignment problems. You may not collaborate with each other on
exams. We encourage you to discuss assignment problems with others in
this course, however, your writing (including code) of solutions must
be your own. A good rule of thumb during a discussion of assignment
exercises is to leave behind all computing devices, writing
implements, paper, and any other material that could be used to record
thoughts and ideas. Using a whiteboard is acceptable, however, all
thoughts and ideas should be **erased** before leaving the room and should
not persist in any form. This will ensure your solutions to be
recorded in isolation and submitted without worry. You should record
as part of your submission those individuals you collaborated with
during a discussion—this will help protect you if academic dishonesty
is suspected. Any outside material including online resources that you
used to develop a solution must be recorded as part of your
submission. Of course, copying any material directly or indirectly
from the web is considered dishonest and is **much easier than you think
for us to detect**, so *don't do it*!

When in doubt, contact the instructor about whether a potential action
would be considered plagiarism. Copying or using sections of someone
else’s program or assignment, even if it has been modiﬁed by you, is
not acceptable. The University has very clear guidelines for academic
misconduct and the TA and instructor of this course will be vigorous
in enforcing them. Please see the
[UMass policy on academic honesty][conduct] if you need clarification.

If you engage in academic dishonesty you will receive an F for this
course. Further, if there are formal disciplinary proceedings, we will
lobby for the maximum possible penalty. So, in short, don't do it.

Academic dishonesty is usually the result of other problems in
school. Please come see us or the TAs if you are unable to keep up
with the work for any reason, and we will try to work something
out. We want to see you succeed! We will bend over backwards to help
you, but we will not tolerate academic dishonesty.

Investigating academic dishonesty is an unpleasant experience for both
the instructor and the student. Please help us by avoiding any
questionable behavior.

## Other Academic Regulations

The [Office of the Registrar] publishes [Academic Regulations] yearly. You
should be familiar with them. Particularly relevant are the policies
on attendance, absences due to religious observance, and examinations.
