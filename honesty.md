# Academic Honesty

## Overview

It is very important in all courses that you be honest in all the work that
you complete. In this course you must complete all assignments, quizzes,
exams, etc. on your own unless otherwise specified. If you do not you are
doing a disservice to yourself, the instructors for the course, the School of
Computer Science, the University of Massachusetts, and your future. We design
our courses to provide you the necessary understanding and skill that will
make you an excellent computer scientist. Assignments and exams are designed
to test **your** knowledge and understanding of the material. Plagiarism and
academic honesty of any sort may seem like an easy way to solve an immediate
problem (which it is not), however, it can have a substantial negative impact on
your career as a computer science student. There are many computing jobs out
there and many more people working hard to get those positions. If you do not
know your stuff you will have a very difficult time finding a job. Please take
this seriously.

We will carefully review your submissions automatically and manually to verify
that "cheating" has not taken place. If you are suspected of plagiarism we
will follow an informal path to determine if academic dishonesty has taken
place. If you are found guilty you will receive an F for the course and it
will go on your permanent record at UMass. This will disrupt your schedule for
completing courses and may lead to you not completing your degree in a timely
fashion. You should carefully review the [Academic Honesty Policy][honesty], 
[Avoiding Plagiarism][avoid], and the [Academic Honesty Flowchart][flow] to
understand what academic honesty is, how you can avoid it, and the procedure we
will follow if you are under suspicion. 

We will be using [MOSS], an automated system for detecting software
plagiarism. All your code submissions will be checked by MOSS to determine if
there was any sharing of code between your submission and other student
submissions from this semester and previous semesters. Each assignment
submission will be tested and reviewed. You will be contacted if we find any
likely similarities in your code and other submissions.

Every assignment includes a "contract" that you sign virtually by submitting
your assignment. By "signing" this contract you indicate that you have read all
the documents on this website and any links to academic honesty associated with
the university. Your signature indicates that you completely understand the
policies in place and that you have not plagiarized. Here is an example of what
you will see on each assignment, quiz, and exam:

## CMPSCI 220 Academic Honesty Policy

Excerpts from the campus Academic Honesty Policy, which may be found at

* [Academic Honesty Policy and Procedures][acadhonest]

"Since the integrity of the academic enterprise of any institution of higher
education requires honesty in scholarship and research, academic honesty is
required of all students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.  Academic
dishonesty is prohibited in all programs of the University. Academic dishonesty
includes but is not limited to: cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and
facilitating dishonesty. [The full policy defines these in more detail.]
Appropriate sanctions may be imposed on any student who has committed an act of
academic dishonesty. Instructors should take reasonable steps to address
academic misconduct. Any person who has reason to believe that a student has
committed academic dishonesty should bring such information to the attention of
the appropriate course instructor as soon as possible."

Specifics for this course:

1. Except for a few small requirements, assignments in this course are
   individual, not group, and direct collaboration is inappropriate.  Any group
   work we will clearly mark as such.

2. While we support learning from your peers, the rule of thumb is that any
   learning will be in your head.  Therefore you should not leave an encounter
   (in person or electronic) with anything written down (or electronically
   recorded) that you did not have before.  Thus, giving or receiving
   electronic files is specifically considered cheating.

3. Use of materials from previous offerings of this course, no matter the
   source and even if you are re-taking the course, is prohibited.

4. We will employ various means, electronic and otherwise, to check for
   compliance with these course policies.  We will pursue sanctions vigorously
   and the usual sanction we will pursue is an F in the course.

Resources available to you:

1. The instructor and teaching assistant(s) are eager to help you learn and to
   work through any difficulty.  We can sometimes grant short extensions (the
   structure of the course generally prevents long ones), and in more difficult
   situations will try to develop a workable plan with you.  We strive for
   ready accessibility by email and online discussion forums, and will make
   strong effort to meet you in person, though schedules are not always easy to
   work out.

2. The Learning Resource Center on the 10th floor of the main library offers
   support for this course with trained tutors for free, available on a wide
   schedule.  They can be reached at lrc@acad.umass.edu and 1-413-545-5334.

Honesty pledge:

I pledge to obey these honesty policies for CMPSCI 220 and to report any
violation of them that I witness.
