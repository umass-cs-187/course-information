# Course Policies

## Online Attendance

For the online version of this course there is no official physical
meeting time for the course. We expect that you will be present by
reviewing the material released for each week and starting assignments
and exercises promptly. We expect you to ask questions regarding the
material for each week.

**Incompletes:** will be granted only in exceptional cases, and only
if you have completed at least half of the course. Prior to that
*withdrawal* is the recommended course of action.

## Late Submissions

Late submissions for any assessment component will not be accepted. It
is your responsibility for maintaining your own schedule and being
prompt with your submissions. We expect that you become familiar with
the course submission software ([moodle]) and verify that your
submission has been properly uploaded (i.e., download your submission
from [moodle] to ensure you submitted has been received). We will
**not accept** late submissions due to lack of checking on this. We
assume:

* You are an adult and have the ability to check and verify your work
  has been received safely by [moodle].
* You are capable of using DropBox, Google Drive, or some other backup
  software to ensure that your work is not lost in the event of a
  computer failure.
* You have a back-up plan in place in the event that your computer
  fails or your internet connection is unavailable. Make sure you have
  a plan B and C if your computer crashes or your internet is
  unavailable. This is **your responsibility**.

To ensure that you submit assignments on time you should begin them
early and do not wait until the last minute to submit to [moodle]. You
will be able to submit to [moodle] multiple times so submit often and
early to ensure you have something submitted. Work you are not able to
submit because you procrastinated  until the last possible submission
time will not be accepted.

Late submissions will only be accepted for *extreme circumstances*
beyond your control. This includes death, extreme illness (not a cold,
cough, or flu), etc. These cases must be accompanied with a doctor's
detailed written note or some other authority associated with your
circumstance. If this is a continuing matter we will recommend that
you withdraw from the course.

## Academic Dishonesty

All submitted work **must be your own**. Although students may study
together, each student is expected to produce his or her own solution
to the assignment problems. You may not collaborate with each other on
exams. We encourage you to discuss assignment problems with others in
this course, however, your writing (including code) of solutions must
be your own.

You should record as part of your submission those
individuals you collaborated with during a discussion—this will help
protect you if academic dishonesty is suspected. Any outside material
including online resources that you used to develop a solution must be
recorded as part of your submission. Of course, copying any material
directly or indirectly from the web is considered dishonest and is
**much easier than you think for us to detect**, so *don't do it*!
This includes code and/or resources that have a public/shareable
license.

When in doubt, contact the instructor about whether a potential action
would be considered plagiarism. Copying or using sections of someone
else’s program or assignment, even if it has been modiﬁed by you, is
not acceptable. The University has very clear guidelines for academic
misconduct and the TA and instructor of this course will be vigorous
in enforcing them. Please see the
[UMass policy on academic honesty][conduct] if you need clarification.

If you engage in academic dishonesty you will receive an F for this
course. Further, if there are formal disciplinary proceedings, we will
lobby for the maximum possible penalty. So, in short, don't do it.

Academic dishonesty is usually the result of other problems in
school. Please contact us or the TAs if you are unable to keep up with
the work for any reason, and we will try to work something out. We
want to see you succeed! We will bend over backwards to help you, but
we will not tolerate academic dishonesty.

Investigating academic dishonesty is an unpleasant experience for both
the instructor and the student. Please help us by avoiding any
questionable behavior.

## Other Academic Regulations

The [Office of the Registrar] publishes [Academic Regulations] yearly. You
should be familiar with them. Particularly relevant are the policies
on attendance, absences due to religious observance, and examinations.
