# CMPSCI 187 Programming With Data Structures - Schedule

## Weekly Format
In order to cover the same amount of material required by the regular
semester course in a shorter period of time we will be following a
fairly strict and intensive schedule. Course material will be provided
on the Monday of each week during the course. This will include any
reading, presentation material/video that you will be required to
view, possible activities that you will complete, and discussion
questions that you will be required to contribute toward. The
assignment for the week will also be available on Fridayâ€™s and will
always be due at 1 am on the following second Monday (10 days). You
may submit the assignment at any point between the time it is
available and the due date.
