# Course Schedule

You should consult the [UMass academic calendar][umasscal] to make
sure you are aware of important dates and events. The following are
the weekly topics that will be covered during this course. Be aware
that the schedule is subject to change during the semester at the
instructor's discretion.

## Course Chapters

As is the case in any course we are looking to teach you important
ideas, concepts, and techniques through a story that makes sense. The
best way to visualize the path we will be taking is through a top-down
approach. This is similar to how you might evaluate a technical book
you are interested in reading by skimming through the
chapters. Although the details are important they are not helpful in
gaining insight into the larger picture the course is aiming to
achieve. Here we lay out this course by "chapters" and follow that
with a list of "sections". We leave the details to the actual lectures
and the material we will be covering in each. If you are interested in
some of the more detailed objectives you should consult the course
[syllabus](syllabus.md).

### Chapter 1 Programming Principles

The first chapter of this course will cover material that will help
you move from a novice programmer to one that has a deeper
appreciation of programming and its intricate parts. Programming, and
software development in general, is a great deal more than "writing
code". It is about understanding how programs are constructed, what
the interfaces are, what the tools are, source version control,
testing, and communication. In this chapter we will begin with a
familiar language (e.g., Java) and look at some details of the
language that you may not be aware of as well as some of the built-in
data structure libraries that exist. We will cover version control
using git, how it relates to other systems (e.g., subversion,
mecurial), and basic commands that will help you safeguard
implementation decisions, work with others, and experiment with
ideas. We will cover the command line and why it is important for
effective programming and software development. Principles of good
programming practice will be discussed to lay the groundwork for the
rest of the course. We will also begin our transition to the Scala
programming language from the perspective of Java. Learning new
languages is a skill that must become familiar to any computer
scientist and will be emphasized throughout the course.

### Chapter 2 Programming Paradigms and Patterns

The second chapter of the course will emphasize programming techniques
and patterns that are crucial for solving a variety of problems. Not
all programming languages are created equal - they are often designed
for a specific purpose in mind or from a certain philosophical
standpoint. We will ask the question of why we have so many different
programming languages and see some examples. We will increase our
understanding of the Scala programming language in particular and look
at how it embodies both object-oriented and functional paradigms. We
will focus on the functional aspects of Scala and understand what
makes a language "functional". The concept of immutability and
referential transparency will be discussed and several "design
patterns" will be covered that identify common approaches for solving
common design issues. We will investigate software reuse by comparing
and contrasting two common object-oriented language techniques,
composition and inheritance, and look at why you might choose one over
the other. We will also increase our understanding and knowledge of
building larger programs with build automation and additional testing
techniques.

### Chapter 3 Programming in the Large

The third and final chapter of this course covers concepts that arise
in modern software development. We will introduce regular expressions,
a technique that allows sophisticated text processing through pattern
matching using a domain specific language. Libraries, both how to use
them and create them, will be investigated as well as how to
conceptualize and design sensible application programming interfaces
(API) that can be used effectively by 3rd party developers. We will
look at a selection of parallelism patterns that bridge your
understanding between serial code and programs that exploit
concurrency. This will lead to an emphasis on data patterns and how to
organize applications around a database system and separate the data
layer, business logic, and view to implement applications with a
sensible architecture. Other architectural patterns will be explored
such as model-view-controller. Lastly, we will look at how to design
and implement domain specific languages, a useful tool in any
programmers pocket, to solve problems in a domain specific
environment.
