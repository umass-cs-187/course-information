## CMPSCI 187 Programming With Data Structures - Course Management

This course will use a number of web-based services. Because this is an online
course we will not have any on campus meeting days. You will be required to
create accounts for any of the systems mentioned below at the start of the
course. Failure to do so will make it difficult for you to complete the course
successfully. You will be notified at the start date of the course and given
instructions on which applications and/or services you must register for. This
course **is not** using Blackboard or Moodle for a learning management system.

## Communication
### Piazza
[Piazza][piazza] is a online discussion management system. It will be used as
the hub for communication in this course. All questions and answers will be
posted to Piazza. Your questions will be answered as quickly as possible by
the course staff. You will be responsible for visiting Piazza several times a
day to see updates. We will be posting all assignment, discussion, and exam
information on Piazza. You should review the Piazza [feature list][features] to
get an understanding of how to use Piazza. You will receive an invitation to
join the course on Piazza on or before the course start date.

## EMail
### Submissions
You will be informed of the email address you should use to submit your
assignments as attachments. You will be asked to format your subject line in
your email precisely so that we can easily filter your submissions. It will
be required that you use your school email address so that we can verify
who you are.

### Grades
We will be using email to send out a summary of your grades each week. It is
your responsibility to monitor your grades. If you have questions about your
grades you should send a private post to the course staff on [Piazza][piazza].

## Assignments
### Github
[Github][github] is an online source versioning control system (VCS). All the
assignments for the course will be retrieved from Github. You **will not be
required** to learn [git][git] in order to retrieve your assignments - but, it
is good to be exposed to a VCS as you will encounter it in future computer
science courses. You **will be required** to create an account on Github so
that I can provide you access to the assignment repositories for download. We
will also be using Github to provide access to comments on your graded
submissions. We will create a private repository for you and give you access
when your Github account has been created.
