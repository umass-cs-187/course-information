# Course Management

This course will use a number of web-based services. Because this is an online
course we will not have any on campus meeting days. You will be required to
create accounts for any of the systems mentioned below at the start of the
course. Failure to do so will make it difficult for you to complete the course
successfully. You will be notified at the start date of the course and given
instructions on which applications and/or services you must register for.

## Piazza

[Piazza][piazza] is a online discussion management system. It will be
used as the hub for communication in this course. All questions and
answers will be posted to Piazza. Your questions will be answered as
quickly as possible by the course staff. You will be responsible for
visiting Piazza several times a day to see updates. We will be posting
all assignment and exam information on Piazza. You should review the
Piazza [feature list][features] to get an understanding of how to use
Piazza. You will receive an invitation to join the course on Piazza on
or before the course start date.

Piazza is a great tool. At the same time it can be abused. You should
use Piazza to ask questions and get advice on assignments. You may not
use Piazza to step through each problem you encounter in an
assignment. If you do this it is easy for us to identify and we will
make note which may possibly impact your final grade in the
course. Your posts to Piazza should be thoughtful and articulate. If
you must post code you are working on your should do so only through
private posts to the course instructors. You should not post code
without a thoughtful and articulate question. Please do not post code
and ask "what is wrong with my code".

Course staff will monitor Piazza and answer your questions in a timely
manner. You are welcome and encouraged to help other students with
answering questions - this will make you look good and potentially
improve your final grade in the course. If a question has already been
answered in a previous post we may not respond to you. If a question
does not follow the guidelines above we may not answer it. If we find
that a private question is relevant to a larger audience we will make
it anonymous and post it publicly to help others in the course.

## Moodle

We will be using the [moodle] learning management system for
assignment submissions and exams. You should have had an account
automatically created for you at the beginning of the course. If you
are unable to log in to [moodle] you should contact the instructor
immediately during the first day of the course. If you haven't used
[moodle] before it is your responsibility to become quickly acquainted
with its interface so you are productive and do not encounter any
surprise issues later.

Grades will be available through the [moodle] gradebook. You should
orient yourself with how to find it and stay on top of your grades to
avoid any grading issues.

## Eclipse

We will be using the Eclipse Development Environment for completing
programming assignments. You are required to use Eclipse for
programming. All programming assignments are distributed as Eclipse
projects and you will need to become acquainted with how to import
and export projects. This will be covered during the first week of
class.

## Java 7

We will be using the Java Development Kit version 7 in this
course. Although there is now a version 8 we will not be using
features in version 8 and all the programming assignments are designed
to work with version 7.
